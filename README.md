# Hello-world
This is my first program on github
I am learning python again. I am surprised how and why when you leave programming, it leaves you. Knowledge can be dissapointing sometimes. I intend to apply this knowledge to everyday chemistry and teach my students its value. God help me.
I am making changes on the master file. This is my commit.
